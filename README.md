##  What Is Vanshavali?

Vanshavali allows users to upload raw DNA data from services like 23andMe or AncestryDNA. Using advanced algorithms rooted in population genetics, it provides clear visualizations and statistical summaries such as:

- Ancestry composition using **qpAdm** modeling  
- Genetic distance and relatedness via **Fst** analysis  
- Visual clustering with **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)  

Whether you're tracing your lineage to the **Indus Valley Civilization** or exploring links to the **Sintashta-Vedic complex**, Vanshavali makes ancient DNA personal.

##  Core Tools and Techniques

### ðŸ”¹ QpAdm â€“ Admixture Estimation  
Estimates how much ancestry comes from various ancient or modern sources.

### ðŸ”¹ PCA â€“ Principal Component Analysis  
Visualizes genetic similarity and clustering across populations.

### ðŸ”¹ Fst â€“ Fixation Index  
Measures genetic differentiation between populations.


### ðŸ”¹ Health Report
Measures genetic risks score for various genetic diseases and generates results .

##  Historical Timeframes Covered

Vanshavali analyzes your DNA in context with major periods of human evolution and migration:

- **Paleolithic** â€“ early human species and hunter-gatherers  
- **Mesolithic** â€“ climate transitions, microlithic tools, and dog domestication  
- **Neolithic** â€“ agriculture, pottery, early settlements  
- **Bronze Age** â€“ metallurgy, trade, urban civilizations  
- **Iron Age** â€“ empires, alphabets, and migration waves

## ðŸ“¥ How to Use Vanshavali

1. Select your ethnicity 
2. Select the refernce population groups and time groups of admixture results.
3. View your genetic breakdown,and population closeness.
4. Export or share your results.

*(In CLI/desktop versions: the tool accepts `.txt`  coordinates and allows admixture modeling with reference populations.)*
